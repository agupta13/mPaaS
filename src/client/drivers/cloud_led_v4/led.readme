#led-class.c and led-core.c are actually part of the led subsystem class in the linux kernel. I did not know this. I tried integrating dell-led.c with ksocket.c, but I ran into some issues while doing insmod(undefined symbol error). I copied over the ksocket.c to dell-led.c to avoid this. the module is getting loaded and we can see appropriate messages in the logs, but when the socket tries to connect(kconnect) its failing and returning an error code of -111. let me know if I'm doing something very obviously wrong.
